# Time series analysis with Python

<script async defer src="https://buttons.github.io/buttons.js"></script>


Welcome to a journey through the world of time series analysis using Python! This book, structured as a series of Jupyter notebooks, serves as both a comprehensive course and a practical guide for students, data scientists, and researchers interested in exploring the interplay between statistical theories and practical applications in time series analysis.

Time series analysis is a crucial discipline in data science, offering insights into patterns over time that are invaluable for forecasting, anomaly detection, and understanding temporal dynamics. The aim of this book is to introduce fundamental concepts of time series analysis from multiple perspectives: statistical, dynamical systems, machine learning, and signal processing. This interdisciplinary approach aims to give the reader a broad view on the world of time series.

The book is designed to combine high-level theoretical knowledge with practical programming skills. Each chapter introduces key concepts of time series analysis, followed by hands-on coding sections. This structure allows you to immediately apply the theoretical concepts you learn, seeing first-hand how these translate into functional tools in data analytics. Through this process, you will gain both the knowledge to understand complex time series data and the skills to analyze and predict it effectively.

To reinforce learning and encourage active engagement, each chapter concludes with exercises. These are designed to test your understanding and help you apply the lessons in practical contexts, ensuring that the knowledge gained is both deep and retainable.

Whether you are new to time series analysis or looking to refine your expertise, this book offers a broad exploration of the field, with Python as your toolkit. I hope that you will find this material both educational and entertaining, brining you a step closer to mastering time series analysis.

## üéì University courses

This book is currently adopted in [STA-2003 Tidsrekker](https://sa.uit.no/utdanning/emner/emne?p_document_id=822793) at UiT the Arctic University of Troms√∏.

## üöÄ Getting started with coding

You can read all the content of this book online. However, to get your hands-on experience with coding you should run the code snippets or the whole notebooks that you can find on Github

## ‚öí Roadmap

```{note}
This is an early version of the book. There might be imprecisions and errors. Also, some chapters might undergo important revisions and changes.
```

I am planning to add more content over time to cover additional topics in new chapters and to extend the existing ones with new examples and explanations.
If there is a specific topic you feel is missing or passages that you feel are not clear enough, open an <a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/FilippoMB/python-time-series-handbook/issues" data-color-scheme="no-preference: light; light: light; dark: dark;" data-icon="octicon-issue-opened" aria-label="Issue FilippoMB/python-time-series-handbook on GitHub">Issue</a> on the repository on Github.

### A note on deep learning

For the moment, I intentionally decided to leave more advanced deep learning techniques aside. There are a couple of reasons for this choice. Firstly, advanced deep learning methods rely heavily on specific knowledge and tools that are generally covered in specialized deep learning courses. This focus does not align with the introductory nature of this book, which is aimed at covering the fundamentals of time series analysis.

Secondly, while deep learning opens up exciting avenues for new applications‚Äîsuch as NLP and analysis of video and spatio-temporal data‚Äîit primarily enhances capabilities in handling diverse data types and scaling to large datasets. However, for the core objectives of this course, which are to understand and manipulate time series data effectively, the advantages of moving from the basic neural networks introduced here to more complex deep learning models do not significantly alter the fundamental approach.
